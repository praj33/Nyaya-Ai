# NYAYA SOVEREIGN GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE

## WHAT IS ENFORCED

The Nyaya AI system enforces compliance with:

### Constitutional Boundaries
- Responses to constitutional queries meet minimum confidence thresholds (0.8+)
- Fundamental rights interpretations follow established precedents
- Directive principles guidance stays within legal boundaries

### Jurisdictional Integrity  
- Cross-jurisdictional legal advice requires proper routing
- Local laws are not applied to foreign jurisdictions
- International law compliance is maintained

### System Safety
- Blocks requests attempting to bypass governance
- Prevents execution of dangerous or malicious queries
- Maintains operational integrity under all conditions

### Confidence Thresholds
- High-stakes domains (criminal, property, constitutional) require 0.7+ confidence
- General domains require 0.5+ confidence
- Low-confidence queries are escalated for review

### Procedural Integrity
- Legal procedures follow proper protocols
- Appeal processes meet higher scrutiny standards
- Evidence requirements are validated before advice

## WHY ENFORCEMENT EXISTS

### Prevention of Hallucination
- Every response must pass through deterministic governance
- No execution path exists outside enforcement controls
- System cannot generate responses without approval

### Legal Compliance
- Ensures adherence to applicable laws and regulations
- Maintains professional legal service standards
- Prevents unauthorized legal practice

### Trust and Accountability
- All decisions are logged with cryptographic proof
- Audit trails are immutable and verifiable
- System behavior is transparent and explainable

### Risk Management
- Protects against liability from incorrect advice
- Maintains system integrity under adversarial conditions
- Provides clear accountability for all decisions

## HOW PROOF IS GENERATED

### Cryptographic Signing
- Every enforcement decision is signed using HMAC-SHA256
- Private keys are stored securely and rotated regularly
- Signature verification ensures authenticity

### Hash Chaining
- All enforcement events are linked in an immutable chain
- Previous hash prevents tampering with historical records
- Chain integrity can be verified at any time

### Event Logging
- Every decision is logged with timestamp, context, and result
- Logs are append-only and cannot be modified
- Complete audit trail is maintained for every trace

### Verification Protocols
- Independent verification of all signatures
- Cross-validation of hash chains
- Regular integrity checks of the entire ledger

## HOW VIOLATIONS ARE DETECTED

### Real-time Monitoring
- Continuous evaluation of all requests against rules
- Immediate blocking of policy violations
- Automatic escalation of suspicious activities

### Anomaly Detection
- Statistical analysis of decision patterns
- Identification of unusual confidence trends
- Detection of potential system manipulation

### Audit Verification
- Periodic verification of ledger integrity
- Cross-referencing of enforcement decisions
- Validation of cryptographic signatures

### Tamper Detection
- Detection of any modifications to historical records
- Alerting when hash chains are broken
- Immediate isolation of compromised components
